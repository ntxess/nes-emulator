Learning RUST through a guide on making an NES emulator.

I'm following a guide on how to make an NES emulator. There are some differences from the guide, but generally I tried to follow it as best I could without completely copying it. Copying it would defeat the purpose of this project. The differences I've made are not improvements, but more to see if I understand how RUST works.
