# nes-emulator
Learning RUST through a guide on making an NES emulator.
This project is use only for educational purposes. I do not claim any code borrowed from the original creator.  

I'm following a guide on how to make an NES emulator. 
There are some structural design differences from the guide, but the project is heavily borrowed and referenced by  
bugzmanov, the original creator. Of course I am also solving the programming problems myself and I do not intend to   
blindly follow the guide.

In addition to the aforementioned guide, I'm also watching a video guide by OneLoneCoder. He explains further upon how the NES emulation works.
